# Codecademy JavaScript

This is a repo of [my personal](http://www.codecademy.com/profiles/phlipper) late-night exploration of, and experiments with, the  [Codecademy JavaScript Course](http://www.codecademy.com/languages/javascript).

I decided to put this repo up after having already made significant progress through the course so this won't contain all of the exercises, but I plan to keep it up as I complete new sections.
